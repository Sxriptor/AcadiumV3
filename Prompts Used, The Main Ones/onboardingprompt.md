## 🎯 GOAL:
Create a complete onboarding flow for **Vibe School (StackedInfo.us)** — a futuristic AI-driven coding and business academy. The goal is to educate, inspire, and convert visitors into registered users. This onboarding process should feel premium, fast, and mission-driven.

## 🧠 CONTEXT:
Vibe School is not a traditional bootcamp. It teaches people how to use AI to build startups, generate income, automate workflows, and unlock modern digital skills. It includes an AI startup generator (Genesis Engine), courses, AI agents, and community.

## 🛠️ PLATFORM:
This onboarding can be for web (React, Framer, or HTML/CSS), mobile app, or Discord bot flow. Focus on flexibility, responsiveness, and modern design patterns.
