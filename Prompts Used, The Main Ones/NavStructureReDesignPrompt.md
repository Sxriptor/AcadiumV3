## 🧩 UX Notes:
- Use a **floating sidebar** with these 5 main tabs
- Each section expands to show internal subsections on hover or click
- Leverage **Framer Motion** or similar to animate category switches with blur and holographic effects
- Maintain dark-mode-first, responsive layout with asymmetric spacing and ambient depth

---

## 🚫 Do Not:
- Show all 12+ categories in the main sidebar
- Use vague naming ("Dashboard", "Factory", etc.) as top-level nav
- Flatten the structure or remove visual hierarchy

## 🔧 Tools & Stack
- Tailwind CSS  
- Framer Motion  
- Radix UI  
- Lucide or Phosphor Icons  
- Responsive grid-based layout  
- Holographic theme (as described in `dashboardprompt.md`)
