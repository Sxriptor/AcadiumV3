# Vibe Coding Academy - Holographic Dashboard Specification

## Overview

Create a sophisticated, futuristic holographic user interface dashboard for **Vibe Coding Academy** - a comprehensive platform focused on building profitable AI tools, automated income systems, and rapid wealth-building through code. The dashboard should be layered with glowing glass panels, iridescent gradients, and dynamic 3D depth. Interface elements float in a zero-gravity layout with asymmetric spacing. Use luminous neons like acid green, cyber purple, and hot pink over deep black and dark slate backgrounds. Panels appear semi-transparent with smooth frosted glass blur and inner glow. Text is high-contrast, semi-monospace, animated with typewriter or glitch effect. Add subtle particle trails, motion blur, and ambient lighting to create a holographic HUD feel ‚Äî as if it's projected in the air by an advanced AI assistant. The overall feel is sleek, elite, and otherworldly ‚Äî a blend between sci-fi control center, cyberpunk OS, and wealth-engineered design. Responsive layout with tactile glowing buttons, animated progress rings, and live data visuals like radars, nodes, and 3D bubbles. No traditional card layout ‚Äî everything looks layered and alive.
